# The HTTP / Websocket extensions.

These are extensions that allow `facil.io` to easily implement HTTP and Websocket services. Please read the project's [README.md](../../README.md) for more details, or visit [facil.io's website](http://facil.io).

**Notice**: these extensions require the core `facil.io` library, including it's `fiobj` core type system. Websockets will also require the `pubsub` service in order for pub/sub to work. The Redis extension can be used to scale pub/sub beyond a single machine.
