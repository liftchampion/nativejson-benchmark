<h1>SSL Certificates</h1>
<h2>What are they and how to create them here</h2>
</center>
<p>Most web traffic is sent unencrypted. That is, anyone with access to the right tools can view most of the traffic that travels the Web. In some circumstances this can be undesirable, such as in credit card and bank transactions.</p>
<p>Where greater web data security is needed, the <b>S</b>ecure <b>S</b>ocket <b>L</b>ayer (SSL) is used to encrypt the data stream between the server and the client (usually a web browser).</p>
<p>If it is true that SSL securely encrypts data travelling over the Internet, then why is a certificate necessary?</p>
<p>The simple answer is that it is NOT!</p>
<p>However, certificates are still useful: A certificate, signed by a trusted <i>Certificate Authority</i> (CA), is designed to ensure that the certificate holder is really who they claim to be. Without a trusted, signed certificate, your data may still be encrypted but you can't be sure who you are communicating with.</p>
<p>If you need a certificate then keep reading and find out more below.</p>

<h4>Note:</h4>
It is usually advisable to select the longest key available (usually 1024 bits).
<p>The actual key length may depend on the browser version.<br>
Because of U.S. regulations, some versions of Netscape navigator can only use RSA code with a maximum of 512 bits. Please visit these links for more information: www.fortify.net <a href="http://babel.altavista.com/translate.dyn?lp=de_en&amp;doit=done&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fortify.net">is worthwhile anyhow,</a> and also <a href="ftp://ftp.replay.com/pub/crypto/browsers/">ftp.replay.com</a> .</p>
<h4>Valid inputs:</h4>
Enter the key length (number of bits) used by the browser. For RSA code, possible values are 512 bits, 768 bits and 1024 bits.
<p>Some types of certificates have a fixed minimum length. Please consult the local CA Policy documents for further information.</p>
