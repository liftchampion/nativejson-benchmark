    <h2>What is This?</h2>

    <p>This is a full-text search system. You can search for documents including some specified words.</p>

    <h2>How to Use</h2>

    <p>Input search phrase into the field at the top of the page. For example, if you search for documents including "computer", input the
    following.</p>
    <pre>computer</pre>

    <p>If you search for documents including both of "network" and "socket", input the following.</p>
    <pre>network socket</pre>

    <p>It is the same as the following.</p>
    <pre>network AND socket</pre>

    <p>If you search for documents including "network" followed by "socket", input the following.</p>
    <pre>"network socket"</pre>

    <p>If you search for documents including one or both of "network" and "socket", input the following.</p>
    <pre>network OR socket</pre>

    <p>If you search for documents including "network" but without "socket", input the following.</p>
    <pre>network AND NOT socket</pre>

    <p>For more complex query, you can use "<code>(</code>". Note that the priority of "<code>(</code>" is higher than that of "<code>AND</code>",
    "<code>OR</code>" and "<code>NOT</code>". So, the following is to search for documents including one of "F1", "F-1", "Formula One", and including
    one of "champion" and "victory".</p>
    <pre>(F1 OR F-1 OR "Formula One") AND (champion OR victory)</pre>

    <h2>You can use DOS wildcard characters</h2>

    <p>If you search for documents including some words beginning with "inter", input the following.</p>
    <pre>inter*</pre>

    <p>If you search for documents including some words ending with "sphere", input the following.</p>
    <pre>*sphere</pre>

    <p>If you search for documents matching some words matching "?n*able" (unable, unavoidable, inevitable, ...), input the following.</p>
    <pre>?n*able</pre>

    <h2>Other Faculties</h2>

    <p>"<code>[...] per page</code>" specifies the number of shown documents per page. If documents over one page correspond, you can move to another
    page via anchors of "<code>PREV</code>" and "<code>NEXT</code>" at the bottom of the page.</p>
