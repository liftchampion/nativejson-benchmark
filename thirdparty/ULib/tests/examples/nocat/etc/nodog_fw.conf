# Specify TCP ports to denied access to when public class users login. All others will be allowed. Note that you should
# use either IncludePorts or ExcludePorts, but not both. If neither is specified, access is granted to all ports to public
# class users. You should *always* exclude port 25, unless you want to run an portal for wanton spam sending. Users should
