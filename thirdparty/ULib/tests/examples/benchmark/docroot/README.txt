                               ULib - C++ library

   ULib is a highly optimized class framework for writing C++
   applications. I wrote this framework as my tool for writing
   applications in various contexts. It is a result of many years of work
   as C++ programmer. I think, in my opinion, that its strongest points
   are simplicity, efficiency and sophisticate debugging. This framework
   offers a class foundation that disables language features that consume
   memory or introduce runtime overhead, such as rtti and exception
   handling, and assumes one will mostly be linking applications with
   other pure C based libraries rather than using the overhead of the
   standard C++ library and other similar class frameworks. It include as
   application example a powerful search engine with relative web
   interface and a multi purpose server (plugin oriented) which results,
   out of John Fremlin accurate investigations, to be one of the
   fastest web application frameworks for serving small dynamic webpages
   (and also make easier the usage of shell scripts for CGI application)

Benchmarking

$ ./configure && make
$ cd tests/examples
$ ./benchmarking.sh (or hello_world.sh)

   Use apachebench (ab)
$ ab -n 100000 -c10 http://10.30.1.131/servlet/benchmarking?name=stefano (or)
$ ab -n 100000 -c10 http://10.30.1.131/servlet/hello_world

Comparative Benchmarking

   I consider in this benchmark the server [G-WAN 3.2.24 (64 bit)]
   (http://www.gwan.ch/) and [NGINX 1.1.16] (http://nginx.net/).

gwan run with the follow options:

-b: enable the TCP_DEFER_ACCEPT option
-d: daemon mode (with an 'angel' process)

nginx is configured in this way:

nginx version: nginx/1.1.16
TLS SNI support enabled
configure arguments: --prefix=/usr --sbin-path=/usr/sbin/nginx --conf-path=/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
--error-log-path=/var/log/nginx/error_log --pid-path=/var/run/nginx.pid --lock-path=/var/lock/nginx.lock
--user=nginx --group=nginx --with-cc-opt=-I/usr/include --with-ld-opt=-L/usr/lib --http-log-path=/var/log/nginx/access_log
--http-client-body-temp-path=/var/tmp/nginx/client --http-proxy-temp-path=/var/tmp/nginx/proxy --http-fastcgi-temp-path=/var/tmp/nginx/fastcgi
--http-scgi-temp-path=/var/tmp/nginx/scgi --http-uwsgi-temp-path=/var/tmp/nginx/uwsgi --with-ipv6 --with-pcre --with-http_realip_module
--with-http_ssl_module --without-mail_imap_module --without-mail_pop3_module --without-mail_smtp_module

nginx run with the follow configuration:

user nginx nginx;
worker_processes 2;

events {
     use epoll;
     worker_connections 1024;
     multi_accept on;
}

http {
    include /etc/nginx/mime.types;
    default_type application/octet-stream;

    log_format main
        '$remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local] '
        '"$request" $status $bytes_sent '
        '"$http_referer" "$http_user_agent" '
        '"$gzip_ratio"';

    client_header_timeout 10m;
    client_body_timeout 10m;
    send_timeout 10m;

    connection_pool_size 256;
    client_header_buffer_size 1k;
    large_client_header_buffers 4 2k;
    request_pool_size 4k;

    gzip off;
    gzip_min_length 1100;
    gzip_buffers 4 8k;
    gzip_types text/plain;

    output_buffers 1 32k;
    postpone_output 1460;

    error_log   off;
    access_log  off;

    open_file_cache max=1000 inactive=20s;
    open_file_cache_valid 30s;
    open_file_cache_min_uses 2;

    server_tokens off;

    tcp_nopush on;
    tcp_nodelay on;

    keepalive_timeout 75 20;

    ignore_invalid_headers on;

    index index.html;

    server {
        listen 8080;
        server_name 10.30.1.131;

        access_log  off;
        error_log   off;

        root /usr/src/ULib-1.1.0/tests/examples/benchmark/docroot;
    }
}

   All tests are performed on an Intel Pentium 4 2.8 Ghz, Hard drive 5400
   rpm, Memory: 2GB DDR2 800MHz running Gentoo 2.0.3 AMD64 (kernel 3.2.7).
   Yes, this CPU is 11-year old (single-core) P4, but some test on more
   recent processor (dual-core AMD) give similar results.

   The client ab.c relies on ApacheBench (ab) and it is a slightly
   modified version of G-WAN client.

   I have considered two scenario for benchmarking:
     * The client as well as the web server tested are hosted on the same computer.
     * The client is running on different computer than the web server (networking is involved).

   I had to increase the local port range on client (because of the TIME_WAIT status of the TCP ports).
     * HTTP Keep-Alives: yes/no
     * Concurrency: from 0 to 1000, step 10
     * Requests: up to 1000000 - within a fixed total amount of time (1 sec)

   For serving static content I use 3 file of different size:
     * 100.html (100 bytes - only 'XXX...' without CR/LF)
     * 1000.html (1000 bytes - only 'XXX...' without CR/LF)
     * WebSocketMain.swf (80K bytes)

   For serving dynamic content I use a simple request: Hello {name}

userver_tcp is the winner of this benchmark for almost all level of concurrency.

More info

   ULib is normally built and installed as a set of shared object
   libraries and header files. These libraries and headers are installed
   using directories selected through a "configure" script that has been
   prepared with automake and autoconf. As such, they should build and
   install similarly to and in a manner compatible and consistent with
   most other GNU software. ULib is free software; you can redistribute it
   and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as
